### Continuous Integration

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Automated tests
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Coding standards
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Static code analysis
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> ...etc.

Note:

These can be any tests you want to run. Unit tests? Code sniffers to check coding standards? Static code analysis tools — any sort of gate you want to set.

Best of all, these will always be run. No more "oh, I forgot to run the test suite" — make the computer handle it!
