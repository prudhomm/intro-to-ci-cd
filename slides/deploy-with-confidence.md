### Deploy with Confidence!

In order to deploy confidently,<br>we must have confidence in our tools.

Note:

If you don't want to be afraid of Friday deployments, it's important to have confidence in the tools you're using. You might still choose to avoid Friday deployments, but it shouldn't be death-march.
