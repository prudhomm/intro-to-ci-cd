### Deploy with Confidence!

In order to deploy confidently,<br>we must have confidence in our tools.

Note:

If you don't want to be afraid of Friday deployments, it's important to have confidence in the tools you're using.

You don't *have* to deploy on Fridays, but the idea of doing so shouldn't give you nightmares. Don't worry: I won't tell your boss.
