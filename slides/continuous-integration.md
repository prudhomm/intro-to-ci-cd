### Continuous Integration

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Run a series of scripts automatically, any time changes are pushed
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> **Continuously integrate** our changes

Note:

The idea of continuous integration is being able to check at any time that the code we're working on fits (or "integrates") with the larger codebase.

We do this by defining a number of scripts and the scenarios under which they should run.

Especially important on multi-developer teams!
