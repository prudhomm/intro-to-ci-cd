### What is a Pipeline?

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> A route from development to production
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Different branches may take different paths

Note:

A pipeline, not unlike the internet, is a series of tubes.

Pipelines define the route from a developer's local machine to production. Which steps does it need to take? What gates are in place?

Different branches may also take different routes — maybe the "staging" branch never goes to prod, but only represents an internal staging server?
