### Continuous Delivery

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Being able to be deploy on-demand
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> One-click deployments

Note:

Continuous Delivery means that we're able to deploy the application at any time, typically through a one-click deployment.

Every necessary step has been scripted, so deployments are as painless as clicking a big "deploy" button.

Scripting everything = nobody can forget a step.
