Note:

There are a bunch of CI/CD providers, and they offer varying sets of features.

Many developers may be familiar or already using Jenkins.

Travis CI is well-known among GitHub users.

Some platforms even provide their own tools, including Bitbucket and what we're going to be using today: GitLab.
