### Dependencies & Artifacts

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Dependency management
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Anything that's generated for your app
    - Compiled and/or minified files
    - Binaries
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Source control should only worry about the <u>source</u>

Note:

Adding Continuous Integration also gives us an opportunity to remove dependencies and artifacts from our repository.

Instead of trying to version third-party libraries we depend on, use a dependency manager (npm, Composer, RubyGems, Maven, etc.) to bring these in.

Artifacts are the things that we build, but aren't *source* — anything generated by Webpack, compiled binaries, etc. If we can run a script to re-create them, get them out of the repo!

CI can rebuild + cache these as necessary. Smaller repos, less chance of conflict.
